# Sound Files Needed

To complete the sound effects implementation, you need to add these two sound files to the `assets/audio/` folder:

## Required Files:

### 1. `collect.mp3`
- **Purpose**: Plays when the character collects chicken, mac & cheese, or plates
- **Suggested sound**: A satisfying "ding", "chime", or "yum" sound
- **Duration**: 0.5-1 second
- **Volume**: Should be pleasant and not too loud

### 2. `game_over.mp3` 
- **Purpose**: Plays when the character hits an obstacle or boundary
- **Suggested sound**: A "whomp whomp whomp" or sad trombone sound
- **Duration**: 1-2 seconds
- **Volume**: Should be noticeable but not jarring

## How to Add:

1. Place the sound files in: `CookoutDash/assets/audio/`
2. Make sure they are named exactly: `collect.mp3` and `game_over.mp3`
3. In `SoundManager.js`, uncomment the sound loading code (lines with `/*` and `*/`)

## Current Status:

‚úÖ Background music working (`background_music.mp3`)
‚úÖ Sound effect functions implemented
‚úÖ Game integration complete
‚è≥ Waiting for sound files to be added

Once you add the files and uncomment the loading code, you'll hear:
- üéµ Satisfying sounds when collecting food items
- üéµ Whomp whomp sounds when losing the game
